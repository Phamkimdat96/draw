We’re building eIOP – Intermediary Onboarding Platform, a centralized system for onboarding intermediaries across all Business Units. It supports multiple Business Areas, LOBs, and countries, so it’s designed for global use.
So far, we’ve completed:
Request Module – captures intermediary details, risk evaluation, and required documents.
Recommendation Module – handles reviews, due diligence checks, and sequential approvals.
The platform ensures compliance, transparency, and efficiency with structured workflows and auto-populated data.

For a quick share with another developer, a general overview is enough. Something like:
“We’re building eIOP, a platform for onboarding intermediaries across all business units. It covers the full workflow from request submission to recommendation and approval, ensuring compliance and governance.”

If you want to emphasize multi-BU and multi-country support, you can add one sentence:

“It’s designed to handle multiple Business Areas, Lines of Business, and countries, so it works for the entire organization.”
